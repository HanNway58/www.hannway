  <h1 style="color:gold; background-color: brown;">Worx Receipes - Worlds Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
  <p>I adapted ths recipe from a book called <cite cite= " http://ww.amazon.xom/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0864119917/">Sydney Food </cite> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting theese eggs on my 1 <sup>st </sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney, I have benn after the recipe. I have since transformed it into Waht I really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I have ever tasted. </p>
  <p>This recipe is what I call a <q> very special breakfast</q>; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
  <h2 style="color:orangered;">Ingredients</h2>
  <p>The follwing ingredients make one serving:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
  <li>1/3 cup of cream <i>( 2 3/4 fl ounces)</i></li>
  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
  <li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:blueviolet; background-color;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Whisk egg,cream and salt in a bowl</li>
	<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat <i> (taking care not to burn the butter)</i></li>
	<li> Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the  edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
	<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
	<li> Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
